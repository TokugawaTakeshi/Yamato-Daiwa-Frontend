```
getStringsOrNumbersArrayLength(targetValue: Array<string | number>): number
```

```stylus
sample = "ALPHA"

p(length(sample)); // => 5 (For V0.54.8)
p(getStringsOrNumbersArrayLength(sample)); // => 1

sample2 = "ALPHA" "BRAVO"

p(length(sample2)); // => 2 (For V0.54.8)
p(getStringsOrNumbersArrayLength(sample2)); // => 2
```

This function may work with array of other values, but it has not been tested.


## Problem

There are no mentions of array literal in Stylus similar to `[]` in C-like languages has been found in the
documentation (please let to know if it has been added).
The question [Array of one element in Stylus](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62357697/array-of-one-element-in-stylus)
had no any answers (last check: 26 June 2021).

Basically, the space-separated values are being detected as array in stylus

```stylus
sample = "ALPHA" "BRAVO" "CHARLIE"
p(length(sample)) // => 3
```

However, the elements count in array could be unknown at advance including one element case.
What if to try to get the `length` of one-element array, the result be... depend on environment.

For the `stylus@0.54.8`, the length of below sample will be `5`. 
It is the length on string value, because the Stylus did not recognise is as one-element array.

```stylus
sample = "ALPHA"

p(length(sample)); // => 5 (For V0.54.8)
```

But the results of same experiment in [Stylus fiddle](https://stylus-lang.com/) was different.
For the 26 June 2021, the output was `1`.
It means the fiddle submits the code to the server width other version of Stylus, where `length` is intended for arrays only.
If nothing changed, it's possible to check the result in browser console.
