# Static preview anywhere page

## Static preview conception

### Problem

Although "Markup and styles in JavaScript" is popular methodology, it has serious problems.

1. State-dependent rendering (for example, if there are not enough items in the data source, no pagination will be displayed).
2. Limited page access (for example, you can't write the markup and styles for the admin panel until don't authorize).
3. The JavaScript-powered applications usually requires the development server for normal operation which make hard
   the demonstration of the progress to customer.
4. The human can not focus on markup, styles and logic simultaneously.

Especially, once minimal working application will be done and realized, the changing of the markup and styles in the
pages like "Thank you for the purchasing!" could be really hard.

### Solution

The **static preview** is the web-page development stage on which the engineer is focusing on markup and styles, herewith:

1. The states like loading and error could be simulated by conditional rendering of Pug.
2. The dummy data could be generated by build-in JavaScript of Pug (and also, most functionality of `@yamato-daiwa/es-extensions`
   including random values generators is available).
3. All pages could be accessed without limitations like authorization (of course, no actual of sensitive data must be in this stage.)
4. No development server required for the viewing of output files: the customer can just open files in the browsers
   and watch the web-page.

But another one feature of this methodology is "(static preview) anywhere page".
In fact, it is the main HTML file with the list of links of each page.
Thanks to it, the customer can just open this HTML file and watch any page.

* Please note that the static preview including Anywhere page is **for development needs only** and **must not be published**.
  The markup and styles created in this stage will be re-used in the next stage of development, but the static preview itself
  is only for the developers and their customers.

## How to create the Static preview anywhere page


### Step1: Prepare the directory and files

Create the directories for static preview: one for the source files and one for the output files.
